# Semester Project 1

## Overview

This project was completed as part of the first Semester Project for the Frontend Development course at Noroff. The goal of the project was to simulate a real-world web agency brief by building a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing website for a fictional client: the **Community Science Museum**. The project had to meet specific user stories and design requirements while adhering to best practices in HTML and CSS.

## Project Goals

The main objective was to create a website for a local science museum targeting children aged 7-15 and their families. The website was designed to be exciting, engaging, and informative, aiming to attract visitors to the museum. Key goals for this project included:

- A modern, accessible, and responsive web presence
- A design that appeals to children without being overly childish
- Meeting WCAG accessibility standards
- Responsive design that works well on mobile, tablet, and large screen devices
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website was built using Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure that it functions well across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Accessibility**: The project was developed to be accessible to a range of users, including those with disabilities, following WCAG guidelines.
- **Semantic HTML**: All HTML is semantic, ensuring clear document structure and improved accessibility.
- **Optimized Images**: All images used on the site are optimized for fast loading on the web.
- **CSS DRY Principle**: CSS was written following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, ensuring maintainable and efficient styling.

## User Stories

The website was built to fulfill the following user stories:
- A visitor can view a **home page** showing key information and impactful imagery.
- A visitor can view a **contact page** with the museum's address, phone number, opening hours, and a contact form.
- A visitor can view a **contribution page** detailing how to contribute to the museum.
- A visitor can view an **exhibitions page** showing upcoming events and available exhibitions.
- A visitor can view a **privacy policy page** detailing the museum's privacy policies.
- A visitor can view a **terms and conditions page** with the museum's terms and conditions.

## Pages and Structure

The following pages were created to meet the project requirements:
- **Home Page**: The main landing page with key information and exciting imagery.
- **Contact Page**: Contact information, including a contact form.
- **Contribution Page**: Information on how visitors can contribute to the museum.
- **Exhibitions Page**: A list of current and upcoming exhibitions and events.
- **Document Pages**: These include the Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions, either together or on separate pages.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling, layout (Flexbox & Grid), and ensuring the site is responsive.
- **Figma**: Used to create a style guide and high-fidelity wireframes.
- **GitHub Pages**: Used to deploy the live version of the website.
- **GitHub Projects**: For managing the project Kanban board and tracking progress.

## Accessibility Considerations

The project was designed with accessibility in mind:
- **WCAG Compliance**: The site was built to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), ensuring it is accessible to users with disabilities.
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of headings, landmarks, and alternative text for images.
- **Color Contrast**: The design follows recommended contrast ratios to ensure legibility for users with visual impairments.
